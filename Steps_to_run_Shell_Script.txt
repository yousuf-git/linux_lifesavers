Follow these steps to create and run a shell script of your own from your Ubuntu home directory:

1. Create a directory to store your shell script
2. Create a file in your scripts folder with a .sh extension
3. Add an execute permission to the file to avoid permission denied errors during execution
4. Use the ./ (dot slash)  notation and run the shell script by name in the Terminal window
5. Press CTRL+C to stop the running Linux script if it does not terminate gracefully

The steps described above are manifest in the following six commands:

$ mkdir scripts
$ cd scripts
$ touch script.sh
$ echo 'echo hello-world' >> script.sh
$ chmod -R 777 .                        # 777 means read, write, and execute permissions for all users
$ ./script.sh
hello-world
